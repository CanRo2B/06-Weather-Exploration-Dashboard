# Title: 06-Weather-Exploration-Dashboard

## Description:
I will be created a dashboard utilizing the Open Weather application.  I used CSS to build out the information boxes.  I used javascript to use the fetch command to retrieve information from the Open Weather site.  

## How to use the Project

Once the page loads, you can type a city name into the search input box.  If you do not enter a city, a prompt box will open up asking you to input a city.  After you input a city, the JavaScript function will call on Open Weather to send weather information about the city asked.  You should receive a temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv Index.  Underneath the search button will show the previous searched cities that you can quickly push to retrieve data.  The bottom cards will host a 5 day forecast of the city inputted.
